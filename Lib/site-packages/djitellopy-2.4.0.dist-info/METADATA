```

For Linux distributions with both python2 and python3 (e.g. Debian, Ubuntu, ...) you need to run
```
pip3 install djitellopy

### API Reference
See [djitellopy.readthedocs.io](https://djitellopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for a full reference of all classes and methods available.

### Simple example
```python
from djitellopy import Tello

tello = Tello()

tello.connect()
tello.takeoff()

tello.move_left(100)
tello.rotate_counter_clockwise(90)
tello.move_forward(100)

tello.land()
```

### More examples
In the [examples](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/tree/master/examples/) directory there are some code examples:

- [taking a picture](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/tree/master/examples/take-picture.py)
- [recording a video](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/tree/master/examples/record-video.py)
- [flying a swarm (multiple Tellos at once)](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/tree/master/examples/simple-swarm.py)
- [simple controlling using your keyboard](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/tree/master/examples/manual-control-opencv.py)
- [mission pad detection](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/tree/master/examples/mission-pads.py)
- [fully featured manual control using pygame](https://github.com/damiafuentes/DJITelloPy/tree/master/examples/manual-control-pygame.py)

### Notes
- If you are using the ```streamon``` command and the response is ```Unknown command``` means you have to update the Tello firmware. That can be done through the Tello app.
- Mission pad detection and navigation is only supported by the Tello EDU.
- Bright environment is necessary for successful use of mission pads.
- Connecting to an existing wifi network is only supported by the Tello EDU.
- When connected to an existing wifi network video streaming is not available.
